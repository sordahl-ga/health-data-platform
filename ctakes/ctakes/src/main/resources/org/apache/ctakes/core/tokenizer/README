Verifying you can produce expected tokenization using included sample data
Running the TokenizerAnnotator analysis engine  
##########################################################################

Launch the "Tokenizer annotator" run configuration.
Open CPE SentencesAndTokensCPE.xml, which uses the analysis
engines listed in SentencesAndTokensAggregate.xml.

The aggregate analysis engine is defined to read from plain text file(s) in 
data\test\sample_notes_plaintext
using the FilesInDirectoryCollectionReader.

Since the sentence annotator processes the text one section at a time, there 
must be at least one section (segment) annotation for the SentenceDetectorAnnotator
to add Sentence annotations. 
Therefore the first analysis engine is the SimpleSegmentAnnotator, which
creates a single Segment annotation that covers the entire text.
Then the SentenceDetectorAnnotator analysis engine adds Sentence annotations.
Then the TokenizerAnnotator analysis engine adds annotations for
tokens, such as PunctuationToken, WordToken, NewlineToken.

Strictly speaking, it would not be necessary to run the
SentenceDetectorAnnotator in order to test the TokenizerAnnotator.
The TokenizerAnnotator does not require the presence of Sentence annotations.
